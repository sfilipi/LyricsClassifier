Cause everybody needs to hide,Why oh why must everyone be in disguise,You get nothing out of living lies,Why? Cause everybody needs to hide,You know I really think it's funny,When you're flaunting all your automobiles,Cause I know that money's something that you oughta conceal,The more you reveal the more we know it all isn't real,I bet you frauds keep talkin' till your coffin is sealed,But it's ok, you behave in anyway that you want,Cause I can look you in the face and know you're fakin' the funk,So take a second and brace yourself for taken this punch,You may leave a little shaken when I break through your front,Chorus,I was just another white kid who suffered an identity crisis,I ain't the only one I know that many are like this,So I did it how I did it never cared if they liked it,Kids got so excited they were ready to bite shit,Me getting on the mic is just like getting a license,To be hittin' all you critics that are stereotypin',My only problem is I got plenty of vices,But I'll Keep on writin' till I'm ready and ripe,Chorus
mightier-than-the-sword    borialis    Rock    I'm spittin' with the venom,To your soul through flesh and denim,I kill every opponent with the message that I send 'em,And I leave 'em, with no heart-beatin', the lungs breathin',Their last thought was questioning the demon they believe in,Forcing me to start kickin' mental martial arts,Piercing they hearts, with all these metaphorical darts,Make use of this verbal abuse and call a truce,'Cause the verse hurts worse, and works quick as a noose,Stop frontin', you wantin' my mouth to stop running,Some sought assault, but the thoughts kept comin',The last man who tried, well, he died in his sleep,I can't believe what I was saying put him 6 feet deep,Diagnosed with an overload flow to his brain,I guess the truth that I told him, must have drove him insane,Any rough @.$@., can pull the trigger, but I'm bigger,The poisoned lyrics make you sick quicker than liquor,So go blast your gun, I'm gonna be the one who'll be yellin' victory,When all is said and done son,Now I'm battling my wars,With chords and metaphors,Lord knows the pen's mightier than the sword,Armed with my thoughts and the almighty force,For sure the pen's mightier than the sword,Destroy the flesh, but the core will endure,Of course the pen's mightier than the sword,So blow me up with a bomb, I'll move on and go beyond,Like the wayward son, and carry on,I'm forever green, I'm what you never seen before,What you thought was raw was far from hardcore,I'm alive on a compact disc, I never miss, I always hit,Assuring I'll forever exist,Three times as arrogant as Cannibis is,Now they teaching classes, calling it The Borial-Analysis,I grip the mic as if I'm never gonna pass it,When I spit the ancient and eternal to the masses,Enthusiastic, opposite of plastic,Just recorded this shit, and it's already classic,Man on a mission, holding my position,With no war paints, just poetic ammunition,Now I'm battling my wars,With chords and metaphors,Lord knows the pen's mightier than the sword,Armed with my thoughts and the almighty force,For sure the pen's mightier than the sword,Destroy the flesh, but the core will endure,Of course the pen's mightier than the sword,Combat, without physical contact, you're under attack,Gettin' bashed, smashed, slashed, and gashed,With the sharp tongue, piercin' your ear drum,It's fearsome, slinging your gun son, I ain't even got one,I'm doing what I say, and saying what I mean,With words that cut clean from a poet supreme,I flip tha Tai-Chi Chuan, droppin' terrorist bombs,With blood from Lebanon like Kahlil Gibran,I reside in the hills outside the city walls,Behind closed doors with the infinite source,While you're dwellin' in your hood, inhaling the smog,I'll be in the woods, puffin' logs talkin' to God,Uninvolved with ya'll, I'm watchin' all far from afar,Loungin' on a mountain top, countin' the stars,Now I'm battling my wars,With chords and metaphors,Lord knows the pen's mightier than the sword,Armed with my thoughts and the almighty force,For sure the pen's mightier than the sword,Destroy the flesh, but the core will endure,Of course the pen's mightier than the sword,Mightier than the sword (3X)

holocaust    borialis    Rock    They say the end's near,But I'll approach it with no fear,When the smoke clears I'll find my spirit is still here,May take years to find it the prophets are real,Too much damage to inhabit the planet, that's severe,I talk shit you heartless paupers can't feel,With concepts the smartest robber can't steal,Your fears will cause all ya'll to pour tears,Cause the bomb that I'm droppin' is landing, so stand clear,Are there any queers here in the theater tonight?,We'll get 'em up against the wall and stick 'em with dynamite,Cause there's something going on in my head that ain't right,But I'm getting ready to take flight, so hang tight,It don't matter if you're standing tall,If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall,Don't gonna try to abide by the law,No one alive is surviving the holocaust,It don't matter if you're standing tall,If your thinking small, we all rise and fall,Don't gonna try to abide by the law,No one alive is surviving the holocaust,Fuck partying like it's 1999,Ain't watching the ball fall, ain't calculating time,Watching polar caps melt, and the coastline rise,See the ocean divide, and nine planets align,Sun shining too bright, igniting the Alpines,With petrified eyes were watching at ringside,Can't run, you can't hide, panicking worldwide,When straight out the sky, falls great balls of fire,I'll sneak on the spot where the shuttle is launched,Strap me and a broad onto a rocket and blast off,We'll be following the way of the Force like Star Wars,And I'll start a new fam' when I land on Mars,It don't matter if you're standing tall,If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall,Don't gonna try to abide by the law,No one alive is surviving the holocaust,It don't matter if you're standing tall,If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall,Don't gonna try to abide by the law,No one alive is surviving the holocaust,Now when the end comes, and your time here is done,Will you look back and say, overall, it was all fun?,Well life's been good to me so far like Joe Walsh,But it won't break my heart if it all falls apart,It don't matter if you're standing tall,If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall,Don't gonna try to abide by the law,No one alive is surviving the holocaust

Don't you see?,When I'm with you I loose control.,When I'm with you I am irrational.,And when you're near I fall in love.,Gripping fears unknown.,It's getting harder to breath.,The little things that guarantee.,And this slow surefire dance.,I need you to know that I want you this way.,I'll take everything you are.,I'll take the fall for you.,Show you I will...give everything I am
taken    brightwood    Rock    I am taken,I am not my own,I am floating,Teach me how to fly,I am Solomon,Waiting to sing his song,I am for you, I am for you,And I am older,But I feel so new,I am unfaithful,I am true,You know I'm so in love with you,I am all these things,But I'm nothing without you
swan-song    brightwood    Rock    Come alone and make no,Attempt to save yourself from what you know,Had to happen,Come alone,Come alone,I wish I would have listened when I figured out,You knew me from the inside,Your eyes on mine, on mine, and I'm,I'm afraid and alone with your eternal love in my hands,And this bread, your body,I know, I know, I know, you know,Come alone,From the garden to the hill,Come my love,I have fallen,I have betrayed,So irresolute in my mind,I can't stop pacing, anticipating,Could this be my fate in the end?,Cause I'm afraid in the light of the look in your eyes when they're locked on mine,I turn away, cause I know you see right through me,Come alone,From the garden to the hill,Come my love,I have fallen,I have betrayed you,Here I lie,My guilt is my sentence,You have been my life,I will end it with a kiss,Come alone, my love,My love, my love,(I have fallen),(I have betrayed)
in-memory    brightwood    Rock    You say your hurting is over.,It feels like you're back from the dead.,But still I can't believe it's over,,And I can't get your sight, your scent from my head.,It seems like these moments are lasting forever,,The times when we felt alive.,You carried my heart in the midst of this battle,In your hands.,This time I won't try to reach you.,You're already too far gone.,Slipped past and I didn't notice,,Did we ever sing the same song?,Two lives, two books of illusion,,A chapter in the essence of time.,The story we wrote in one season,,Came to an end in one night.,Remember the times when we started believing,,That everything would be alright?,You carried my heart in the midst of this battle...,In your hands.,And I'll wait for you. I'll become something new.,And I'll sing for you until this dream comes true
